## Hi there 👋

Hi — I'm Mastikica. I build small open-source tools, explore web development, and write about simple automation.

I'm open to collaboration and learning new things. This repository is my GitHub profile README and is intended to stay small and focused.

Assets and images
- Put images under the `assets/` folder at the repository root.
- Keep individual images under 200 KB. A workflow will block PRs adding larger images so please optimize before opening a PR.

If you'd like me to add a project or example code here, open an issue with the goals and I will create a new folder with a minimal manifest and README.
